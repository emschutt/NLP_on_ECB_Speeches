# NLP_on_ECB_Speechers
This project replicates and extends Amaya and Filbien (2015) by applying text-as-data methods to ECB press conference statements. It measures similarity and sentiment in ECB communication and evaluates how communication affects financial market reactions, with transparent and replicable methodology.
